# 💌 confession

**confession** is a personal project I built as a way to express feelings—quietly, sincerely, and without pressure. It's a simple and minimal web page designed to deliver a heartfelt message to someone special.

Sometimes words are hard to say out loud, so I made this as a small space where those unspoken thoughts can live.
